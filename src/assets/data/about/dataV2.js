    "PetZ Money is a virtual pet platform that uses blockchain technology, gamefi elements, and the Pomodoro technique to incentivize users to be more productive. Users start a Pomodoro session and focus on a single task for 25 minutes. If they are successful, they earn in-game currency that can be used to purchase food, toys, and other items for their pet. After four Pomodoro sessions, users are rewarded with a longer break and more in-game currency.",
